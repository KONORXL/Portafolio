### User Profile

This individual is likely in the process of completing their studies or has recently graduated. They have a strong interest in building and showcasing their skills in programming, web development, and related technical fields. They are motivated, ambitious, and eager to present their professional experience, education, and projects to potential employers, peers, or clients. This user values a well-organized, visually appealing portfolio that is easy to navigate and highlights their competencies in frontend and backend technologies.

### Information Architecture
The website's information architecture has been thoughtfully designed to ensure a logical flow and ease of access. The main sections include the header with navigation buttons that correspond to key sections of the page: "General Info," "Education," "Skills," "Work Experience," and "Projects." Each button triggers smooth scrolling to its respective section, ensuring a seamless user experience. The content structure starts with a personal introduction in the "General Info" section, followed by a detailed overview of the user's academic background in the "Education" section. Next, the "Skills" section employs a Swiper slider to visually display technical proficiencies. The "Work Experience" section highlights professional roles with detailed cards, and the "Projects" section concludes the page with a placeholder for future project showcases. This organization makes it easy for visitors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's profile.

### Visual Design
The visual design of the website has been crafted to balance professionalism with modern aesthetics. The background uses a dark theme (#1A1A1A), creating a sharp contrast with the white text and light-colored elements, enhancing readability. Interactive elements, such as the navigation buttons and Swiper slider, are highlighted with subtle hover effects and smooth transitions to engage the user without overwhelming them. Custom icons are used for social media links, sized appropriately to maintain visual hierarchy and alignment. Additionally, the design incorporates rounded borders, a touch of transparency, and a blur effect for certain elements to convey a sense of modern sophistication. The use of consistent margins, padding, and balanced spacing ensures the page is easy on the eyes and supports a clear reading path. Typography choices include serif fonts for headers and standard sans-serif for body text, ensuring a professional yet approachable feel throughout the site.
